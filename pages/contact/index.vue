        <p>Hey ! Welcome to my little pocket of the internet. Whatever it is that brought you here, I hope you stay a minute. I created this space to bring to life some of my favorite things. To offer a glimpse into my world, perhaps. Although my career tethers me to a computer screen, I try to get outside and play as much as I can. I learned to appreciate the beauty of travel and long stays away from home at a young age. Since then, I've seeked out adventure and new experiences any chance I get. I've been fortunate to witness much of the wonders of California over the past 10 years -- it's hard to get enough. </p>
        <p>I don't live my life by any philosophy per se, but I believe it's important to stay attuned to what brings you joy. It's easy to get lost in our hyper-connected culture of self-betterment and comparison. I try to remind myself that most of that stuff doesn't matter. Spend time doing the things that light you up. You might learn something new. Gain a new perspective along the way.</p>
        <p>As I build my company and my brand, I'm slowly accepting new web projects that align with my personal values. If you're interested in working together or having a chat, give me a shout.</p>
